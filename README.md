1. This is a python-based project that uses flask for frame works.
2. Posts and gets data from a PostgreSQL database locallly. (SQL Cloud is a work in progress, still configuring tcp/ip)
3. Deployed on Google Cloud Platform (Current running at https://mk-owdxedlxuq-wl.a.run.app/)
4. Still implementing a mailing system to notify user when a reservation has been made
